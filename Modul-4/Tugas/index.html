		    <p>What is Sass? That's the question we here to answer. If you're new to web design, you've probably heard the term floating around, but you might not be quite up to speed with exactly what Sass is,  what is does, and whether or not you should be using it. In short, Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS. The aim is to make the coding process simpler and more efficient. Let'sexplore in more detail. 
		   </p>
		    		<h4>How to use Sass</h4>
			<p>Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.

			Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS. The only requirement for using it is that you must have Ruby installed. Users are also asked to follow the Sass Community Guidelines.
		    		
			In the following section, we'll outline some basic tips for using Sass, using examples from the official Sass website. Take a look at the Sass Documentation for additional references and examples.</p>

					<h4>Syntax</h4>
			<p>Sass includes two syntax options:
			<ul>
			<li><p>SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses the .scss file extension and is fully compliant with CSS syntax
			</li><li><p>Indented (simply called 'Sass'): Uses .sass file extension and indentation rather than brackets; it is not fully compliant with CSS syntax, but it's quicker to write
			</li></ul>
			<p>Note that files can be converted from one syntax to the other using the sass-convert command.
